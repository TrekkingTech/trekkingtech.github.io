I have never been the one to spend all my money on the new flagship phone each and every year. I have never been the one to go for the high-end phones at all actually. I've had a couple of second-hand iPhones, a cheap but reliable Huawei, and my last phones were Samsung Galaxy xCover 1 and 2. After buying the first Galaxy xCover, I became a true Samsung fan. It was cheap, had all I needed in the specs including the fact that it was IP67 certified. This last bit was truly important to me. I spend a lot of time outdoors and the reason I even needed a new phone was that my Huawei died from drowning.
Then last year I decided to invest a bit in my new phone, and bought the flagship Galaxy S5. Here were the main reasons for buying my S5:  
- **Camera** - I have a compact and DSLR, but when going out I rarely bring them. My motivation for taking pictures is purely to save memories, and not to have photography as a hobby. The S5 had a highend camera, but so did HTC M8 One, and the iPhone 6.  
-  **Battery** - the S5 had a fair enough capacity battery, it was possible to do wireless charging, but most importantly it was *removable* and they sold a seperate battery charger.  
-  As a flagship phone it was likely to get **rooted** - I had problems finding rooting tutorials for the xCover and xCover 2.  
- **microSD support** even though it is deprecated by Google and Apple doesn't care for it. And considering the 16GB internal memory it is a must.  
- Samsung had chosen to make their S5 **IP67 certified** as a standard, not only available for some second tier lower spec model like the example of their S4 Active. This was the selling point that took me away from HTC and Apple.  
Samsung have now released information on their newest flagship phones, the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 Edge. Obvious improvements were of course processor, memory, camera and screen as expected. *Not expected* was that they have used high end materials like aluminum and glass whereas they are known for using plastic also in their highend models.  
**My big disappointment:**  
- Not waterproof.  
- No microSD support.  
- Non removable battery.  
I could live with the non-removable battery as I do have quite a few Power Banks laying around, but removing microSD support... unforgivable. The opinions around microSD on phones, tablets and phablets differ, but for those who didn't consider them reliable had the choice not to use them. With the S6 the choice is made for you, you can't. I am curious to see how this pans out, and to see whether the new Note will still have microSD support.

If you have any thoughts on whether or not microSD should be supported, please send me an e-mail or something.
