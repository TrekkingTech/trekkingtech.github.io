So I am trying to accomplish what techies have tried to accomplish for years; that is to have all the tech you need in an as small and compact solution as possible. Hence, #ProjectOneDevice. Most can see that in general we are damn close with all the tablets coming closer and closer to covering all our personal computer needs. My problem when I tried this with my new iPad a couple of years ago was that it lacked Java support, and my bank only supported a java solution for access. Today though, there's an app for that. My bank, like so many other banks, have made an app to access accounts, pay bills etc. both for iOS and Android. This is a fact when it comes to just about anything today; there's an app for that!  
I was at my grandmothers the other day, and was asked by my mother to install Skype on her iPad. Yes, my 83 year old grandmother has an iPad. And I had a little laugh by myself in the corner of her sofa, when I entered the app-store and saw that she had searched for something in the search field. Not an app, no, she had searched for information you typically Google, but in the App Store. And while I was having my little laugh on her behalf I thought to myself - why am I really laughing. My grandmother had serendipitously stumbled upon a fact I've been too narrow minded to see. Any App store is in fact a search engine. People make informative apps all the time, mostly because those are the easiest ones to make. Also, when developers make apps many of them put serious thought into naming their apps. This is because the principles of Search Engine Optimisation also applies to app names. See TED talk. It is basically the same thing.  
I considered this for a moment, and then researched a bit. This seems to be the evolution of tech for the next years coming. The PC's are out, Android and iOS mobile devices are in. At least this is true for most daily usage. For serious gamers and 3D-designers and many other, nothing will beat the brute power of a desktop computer, but for everything else most of us hold the power in the palm of our hands. Canonical have tried to take advantage of this.  
Canonical, the company to provide us with our favourite flavour of Linux, namely Ubuntu, brought to the table an endearing concept with their "Edge". The question was "why do we need all of these devices?". Most of us have a smartphone, and an even smarter tablet, and yet an even more powerful laptop computer. One of the problems emerging from having all these seperate devices is data synchronisation. The solution for most have been cloud-storage. This way you can access all your documents from any device with internet-service. This solution comes at a price though. All cloud-services cost money when you exceed a certain amount of storage-usage. Those services that don't, are usually up and coming services that needs to do this to compete with the big ones like Dropbox. But mind you one day, they will start charging for their service. And what will you do when you have 40gigs of personal files in their cloud.. You'll pay for the service.  
An alternative is to have your own Network Attached Storage NAS that is hooked up to the internet. Whilst this has for quite some time been a solution mostly for advanced users it is becoming easier and easier. Look for instance at the Western Digital MyBook-Live colleciton. This is a Plug-and-Play NAS. My mother could have hooked it up and get it working. Come to think of it, she did. When she did though we stumbled upon a problem I should've foreseen I guess. Uploading the files to the disk using the LAN inhouse, or the USB 3.0 connection goes quite smoothlessly. Downloading it from an external network via the internet though, that takes time. Most households typically have broadband connections with high download speeds, but poor upload speeds. Because most households wouldn't need great upload speeds, they don't usually run servers. Now with these plug-and-play NAS-solutions many home suddenly runs a server, and that requires high upload speeds so that downloads can go smoothly when you connect from an external network. Of course the need differs from person to person, but in my mothers case she wanted to use the NAS for storing family photos and videos. Lately with all the HighRes-digital-cameras the files are big, and the files are many.  
Another problem with all these devices we buy for all their purposes is for one thing all the money you spend, and another is the amount of space it takes and weight it provides when you are going somewhere. Going to an airport with electronic devices provides extra scrutiny towards and extra work for you. Most airports in Europe requires you to take laptops and tablets out from your handluggage and send them through security in separate boxes. If your tablet or laptop hos a protective sleeve in any sort of rubber or neoprene, it too has to be removed. So the more devices you bring, the more hassle it is going through security. Wouldn't it be nice if you had that one device to rule them all…   
So, for Canonicals solution, the Ubuntu Edge. For those of you who haven't heard about it, it was a “super-phone” that Canonical wished to produce and they were going to use crowdfunding to get it done. They asked the highest sum ever, with their demand of million dollar, and whilst they didn't get it they made a world record when it came to crowd funding. One may speculate if this has boosted the big smartphone-producers motivation to boost up the specs of their phones. In addition to the fact that the Edge was supposed to have awesome hardware, their idea for software solution was all the more brilliant. The plan was that it would be an exemplary Android phone in your pocket, but when you got home or to your office you would just dock your phone and it would come up on your screen with a fullblown and fully utilised version of Ubuntu. It would be both your phone, and your desktop computer. So, is this a good idea? I'd say hellz yes! So is it possible, and is there a market for it? Grant you, by having the one device that's suppose to fulfil multiple purposes, it would probably accomplish each individual task more poorly than a product designed for one specific purpose, but you'll have to ask yourself> what is enough, and what would I be willing to sacrifice for this? I recently bought the Samsung Galaxy S5 and my plan for this is that I am going to try for it to fulfil all my computer needs in the time to come.  
Right now I sitting in a cafe at Schiphol Airport in the Netherlands, listening to music from my phone while writing this post on it as well.

There are many excellent Office-suites for the Android OS. I am currently using the WPS Office, previously Kingsoft, completely free. It would be tiresome doing this on the Android onscreen-keyboard though, especially with my butterfingers, so I've bought a Logitech Bluetooth keyboard. It has proper sized keys and the Dvorak-keyboard layout I use is even included in Android, at least the English version.   The only problem with monetization for the companies who would produce such a device is that although they have sufficient hardware, the software solutions aren't good enough to get such a device to sell. Also they wouldn't make as much money if they only sold the one device, instead of selling their cameras, laptops, desktop PCs, tablets, phones etc. I'll try it out though.   
For the next year I'll try to use only my phone to operate my banknig, my writing, my blogging. I will probably have to rely somewhat on my MacBook Pro for some things, but if so I'll share with you what I wasn't able to do from my phone. I know that the appearance and design on my WordPress-site will probably need a computer, but for the blogposts themselves, and hopefully for everything else, there's an app for that
