**A lot** has happened since I last blogged about the "Project One Device", and the most recently is my migration to Jekyll and GitHub Pages. I'll list the foremost reasons for my decision to abandon wordpress:  
1. Cost  
2. Maintenance  
3. Cost   
4. Site responsiveness  
5. and cost.  
I might exaggerate a bit when it comes to cost, but considering how little I've actually blogged the last year... well, the cost of having that one blogpost online for the past year has been high.  
In other news the Project One Device have somewhat hemorraged, for reasons to be disclosed in later posts.  
That's it for now I guess. Hope I get this Markdown down pretty soon.
